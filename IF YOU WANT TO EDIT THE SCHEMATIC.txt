POCKETHOUSE - BY SKYOST
=======================
Please read this if you want to edit or replace the default schematic !

Well, first you need to know that you will not be able to fully delete your old houses (because
the delete process depends of the schematic : the plugin loads the schematic, calculates its
height, its width and its length and replaces every block of the old house by an air block; so
when you replace the schematic, the height, the width and the length change).

So if you want to get through this problem, the only thing you can do is to delete you world.
Yeah, it's pretty simple.

Oh, and if you want to reset or delete the world "pockethouse_houses" (by default), please also
delete the directory "players" which is located in the plugin's directory (../plugins/PocketHouse/players).
Same if you want to delete this folder, please also delete the world. They depend on each other.

Don't forget to change the values of "spawn" and "gap" according to the size of your schematic and
to the server's view distance.

That's all, good game and enjoy this lovely plugin <3
